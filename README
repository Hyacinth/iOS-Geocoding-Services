--WHAT--------
Custom iOS geocoding and reverse geocoding services that call Google's JSON geocoding services directly.


--WHY---------
- To avoid a long-standing, random failure condition in MKReverseGeocoder, possibly due to usage of old APIs, or hitting a usage limit imposed by Google.

- To provide forward geocoding (find coordinate from location), which is not provided in iOS' standard Location Services.
